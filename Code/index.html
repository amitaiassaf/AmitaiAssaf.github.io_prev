			<h2>Modeling chromatin dynamics</h2>
			<p>A common approach to study chromatin dynamics is to tag it with a florescent mark and follow its motion inside the nucleus with a confocal microscope.  
				The end result is a long trajectory. A chromatin locus performs complicated stochastic trajectory. We have developed a method to analyze such trajectories. </p>
			
			<p>We describe below a statistical method to estimate four parameters from Single Particle Trajectories (SPTs).
				Chromatin is in constant motion within the nucleus, and we provide here our matlab code to study the time-lapse imaging of single loci by fluorescence microscopy. The code can be applied to any trajectories of tagged DNA loci. The code allows to  extracts four biophysical parameters from the movement. The method can be used to study the changes following  DNA damages or breaks and can be applied to single locus trajectories in any species.
