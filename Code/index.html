			<h2>Modeling chromatin dynamics</h2>
			<p> A common approach to study chromatin dynamics is to tag it with a florescent mark and follow its motion inside the nucleus with a confocal microscope.  
				The end result is a long trajectory. A chromatin locus performs complicated stochastic trajectory. We have developed a method to analyze such trajectories. </p>
			
			<p>In a new paper published in cell reports (Amitai, Assaf et al. Cell Reports, 18, 1200 - 1214, 2017), we describe a statistical method to estimate four parameters characterizing chromatin dynamics from Single Particle Trajectories (SPTs).
				We provide here our matlab code to study the time-lapse imaging of single loci by fluorescence microscopy. The code can be applied to any trajectories of tagged DNA loci. The code allows to extracts four biophysical parameters from the movement. The method can be used to study the changes following  DNA damages or breaks and can be applied to single locus trajectories in any species.

			<h2>A population dynamics model for clonal diversity in a germinal center </h2>
			<p> Germinal centers (GCs) are micro-domains where B cells mature to develop high affinity antibodies. The GC is seeded by multiple (~50-200) initial B cell clones. Each clone has a unique sequence of the gene coding for the B cell receptor (BCR).  This receptor later becomes the antibody in mature B cells capable of binding and neutralizing an antigen. During the germinal center reaction, B cell clone proliferate and create diverse lineages, where the descendent self-induce somatic hyper mutations.				Inside a GC, B cells compete for antigen and T cell help, and the successful ones continue to evolve and become memory and plasma B cells. We studied the competition between B cell clone using a simple population dynamics model of birth/death and mutation. We find that, like all evolutionary processes, diversity loss is inherently stochastic. We study two selection mechanisms, birth-limited and death limited selection. While death limited selection maintains diversity and allows for slow clonal homogenization as affinity increases, birth limited selection results in more rapid takeover of successful clones. </p>
