			<h2>Modeling chromatin dynamics</h2>
			<p>A common approach to study chromatin dynamics is to tag it with a florescent mark and follow its motion inside the nucleus with a confocal microscope.  
				The end result is a long trajectory. A chromatin locus performs complicated stochastic trajectory. We have developed a method to analyze such trajectories. </p>
			
			<p>In a new paper published in cell reports (Amitai, Assaf et al. Cell Reports, 18, 1200 - 1214, 2017), we describe a statistical method to estimate four parameters characterizing chromatin dynamics from Single Particle Trajectories (SPTs).
				We provide here our matlab code to study the time-lapse imaging of single loci by fluorescence microscopy. The code can be applied to any trajectories of tagged DNA loci. The code allows to extracts four biophysical parameters from the movement. The method can be used to study the changes following  DNA damages or breaks and can be applied to single locus trajectories in any species.
