			<p>These days my main interests lay in unsderstanding chromatin dynamics and nuclear organization and immunology.

			<h2>Enconter events in biology</h2>
			<p>  The DNA is subject to Brownian motion resulting from the interactions with the surrounding water molecules
				and is constantly moving inside a confined domain, which is determined by the cell or nucleus membrane.
				In recent years it has been understood that its dynamics and organization have significant consequences
				on the cellular functions. For example, the encounter between chromosome sites is directly involved in 
				many biological processes, such as gene regulation and DNA repair. One important characteristic of these
				encounter events is their frequency. Since the interacting sites have to come to a close proximity for the
				chemical interaction to occur and because the encounter is largely diffusion limited, these events are 
				inherently rare. The exact implications of these encounter events is still mostly unknown, but over 
				the last decade microscopy methods and chromosome capture techniques have been developed for their study. </p>
			
			<p>  I have used the simple models to study encounter between chromatin site in a large variation of scenarios. 
				We first adressed the question of encounter between two monomers part of the long chain.
				We have found for the first time a complete mathematical formula describing the dependency of the mean encounter time, on the lenth of the polymer chain and the capture radius.
				In a second work, we have looked at the way these rates change when the polymer chain is under confinment and found for the first time an analytical formula describing the depdendency of this rate on the size of the domain.
