			<h2>Enconter events in biology</h2>
			<p>  The DNA is subject to Brownian motion resulting from the interactions with the surrounding water molecules and is constantly moving inside a confined domain, which is determined by the cell or nucleus membrane. In recent years it has been understood that its dynamics and organization have significant consequences on the cellular functions. For example, the encounter between chromosome sites is directly involved in many biological processes, such as gene regulation and DNA repair. One important characteristic of these encounter events is their frequency. Since the interacting sites have to come to a close proximity for the chemical interaction to occur and because the encounter is largely diffusion limited, these events are inherently rare. The exact implications of these encounter events are still mostly unknown, but over the last decade microscopy methods and chromosome capture techniques have been developed for their study. </p>
			
			<p>  I have used simple models to study encounter between chromatin sites in different scenarios. We first addressed the question of the encounter between two monomers part of the long chain in bulk (DNA looping). We have found for the first time, a complete mathematical formula describing the dependency of the mean encounter time, on the length of the polymer chain and the capture radius, which is the distance at which the sites meet. In a second work, we have looked at the way these rates change when the polymer chain is confined in a close domain representing the nucleus, or a chromosome domain. We found an analytical formula describing the dependency of this rate on the size of the domain. Interestingly, we find that encounter and looping can be very effectively regulated by controlling the domain size.
